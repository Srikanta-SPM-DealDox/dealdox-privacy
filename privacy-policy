DealDox Pvt Ltd affiliates are collectively referred to as we and us. Our server, cloud, and data center offerings are just a few of the many things we have to offer. All of these items are collectively referred to in this policy as "Services," along with all of our other offerings and websites.

This policy also outlines your options for how we use information about you, including how to object to specific uses of that information and how to access and amend that information.

When you register for the Services, for instance, you provide your contact information and, in some cases, billing information.

Cookies and Tracking Technologies
DealDox and our third-party allies, like our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons, device identifiers and pixels) to deliver functionality and to identify you across different Services and devices.

Third Party Providers
We may obtain information about you from third-party suppliers of business information and publicly accessible sources (such as social media platforms), such as physical postal addresses, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers, intent data (or user behavior data), IP addresses, and social media profiles, for the purposes of targeted advertising of items that may interest you, sending tailored messages, event promotion, and profiling.

How We Use Your Information
The Services you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us all impact how we use the information we collect. The specific purposes for which we utilize the data we gather about you are recorded underneath.

To customize your experience and provide the Services
We use information about you to operate, improve, and maintain the Services, provide customer support, process transactions with you, verify your identity when you log in, and provide the Services to you. For instance, we use your account name and picture to identify you to other Service users. By automatically analyzing the activities of your team to provide search results, activity feeds, notifications, connections, and recommendations that are most relevant to you and your team, tailored features in our Services also personalize your experience, increase productivity, and improve your ability to collaborate effectively with others. For instance, we may return search results that we believe are relevant to your job function based on your stated job title and activity. We additionally use data about you to associate you with other colleagues looking for your topic skill. To tailor the content and experience you get on our websites, we may use your email domain to determine your affiliation with a specific organization or industry. When you use multiple Services, we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience. For example, we can show you relevant product information as you move through our websites or let you find information from one Service while searching for it in another.

For R&D (Research and Development)
We always look for ways to improve the usefulness, speed, security, integration, and intelligence of our Services. We troubleshoot and identify trends, usage patterns, activity patterns, and areas for integration using the information and collective learnings (including feedback) about how organizations use our Services to enhance their businesses and digital transformation.

To advertise, promote, and encourage the use of the Services
We send you promotional communications that may be of particular interest to you using your contact information and information about how you use the Services, such as via email and by displaying DealDox advertisements on the websites and applications of other businesses. The purpose of these communications, which may be informed by audits of interactions such as counting ad impressions, is to encourage you to participate in the Services and make the most of them. For example, we might send you information about new features, requests for surveys, newsletters, and events we think you might be interested in. We will additionally speak with you about new solutions, service offers, upgrades, and challenges. Under "Opt-out of communications," you can choose whether or not to receive these communications.

Customer Support
We use your information to fix and improve the Services, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash data, and to resolve technical issues you encounter. We share information with a third-party expert to respond to support-related requests when you explicitly permit us to do so.

With your authorization
When you have permitted us, we use information about you for a specific purpose that isn't listed above. With your consent, we may, for instance, promote the Services by publishing customer stories or testimonials.

Security and Safety
We verify your accounts and activity, detect, prevent, and respond to potential or actual security incidents, and monitor and protect against other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, including violations of Service policies, using information about you and your use of the Service.

How We Protect Your Information
To prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction of your personal information, we employ industry-standard security measures. We regularly review and update our security practices to ensure that your personal information is safe.

Data Storage and Security
The data we store is protected by industry-standard organizational and technical safeguards. Even though we take precautions to safeguard your information, we cannot guarantee that information transmitted over the Internet, stored on our systems, or otherwise in our care will be completely secure from outside intrusion. This is because no security system is completely secure. You, not DealDox, are responsible for securing the storage and access to the information you enter into our server or data center services. Users of servers or data centers should configure SSL to restrict access to the databases and other storage locations used and to prevent the interception of information sent over networks.

Access and Control Your Data
Your Rights
You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of it (including for marketing purposes), to have it deleted or restricted, or to receive it in an organized electronic format. You may first need to get in touch with that service to get help with your requests. For all other requests, please contact us using the information in the Contact Us section below. In some cases, your request and options may be limited: for instance, if granting your request would reveal information about another individual or if we or your administrator are required by law or have compelling legitimate reasons to keep the information. If you have asked us to share your data with third parties, such as by installing third-party apps, you will need to get in touch with those third-party service providers directly to have your data deleted or restricted in some other way. You may be able to file a complaint with a data protection authority in the nation in which you live, and work, or believe your rights have been violated if you have unresolved concerns.

Request to stop using your information
Sometimes, you might request that we quit getting to, putting away, utilizing and in any case handling your data where you accept, we don't have the proper freedoms to do as such. You can, for instance, request that we delete your Services account by this policy if you believe it was created for you without your permission or if you are no longer an active user. You could contact us to withdraw your consent to use your information for a limited purpose if you gave it to us, but this will not change any processing that was already taking place at the time. By contacting us as outlined below, you can also opt out of our use of your information for marketing purposes. When you make such requests, we might need some time to investigate them and help you.

Opt-Out
You can unsubscribe from receiving promotional communications from us by updating your email preferences in your Service account settings menu, using the unsubscribe link in each email, or by contacting us as outlined below to have your contact information removed from our registration database or promotional email list. You will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services even after you opt out of receiving promotional messages. In your account settings, you can choose not to receive certain notification messages. Please be aware that you will still receive generic advertisements.
